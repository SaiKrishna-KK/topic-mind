    "feedback": "- **Clarity rating (4/5):** The summary is mostly clear and understandable. It communicates the message that a gaming PC might be a preferable choice over a PlayStation console for certain gamers, and acknowledges the value of PlayStation exclusives. However, the phrase \"Don't let FOMO on a hypothetical console\" is somewhat unclear, as it's not specified whether \"hypothetical\" is referring to a console that doesn't exist or something else.\n\n- **Coherence rating (3/5):** The summary presents two contrasting ideas: building a gaming PC versus choosing the PlayStation 5, but it does not strongly connect these ideas. The jump from recommending a PC to suggesting the PS5 for exclusives is a bit abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.\n\n- **Relevance rating (3/5):** The summary touches on the PlayStation but does not cover other aspects mentioned by the keywords, like Xbox, which could be relevant for a comprehensive understanding of gaming consoles. It could more directly address consoles in a broader sense, including potential comparisons or mentions of Xbox as another major console.\n\n**Suggestions for improvement:**\n1. Clarify what is meant by \"hypothetical console\" to avoid ambiguity.\n2. Improve coherence by providing a better transition between the suggestion to build a gaming PC and the acknowledgment of PlayStation exclusives, perhaps by explaining the benefits of each option.\n3. Increase relevance by incorporating a brief mention or comparison to other consoles such as Xbox to cover a broader spectrum of gaming console options.",
