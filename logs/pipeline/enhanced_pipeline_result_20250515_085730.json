  "evaluation": {
    "feedback": "- **Clarity rating (4/5):** The summary is generally clear and easy to understand. It provides actionable advice on how to approach a job search, such as updating LinkedIn and using ChatGPT. However, it lacks detail on specific strategies for staying structured in the job search or steps on how to actually treat the search like a job, which could enhance clarity.\n\n- **Coherence rating (3/5):** The summary presents several ideas, but they are somewhat disjointed. The transition between treating the job search like a job and the specific tools/suggestions is abrupt. More explicit connections between updating LinkedIn, using ChatGPT, and overall job search strategy would improve coherence.\n\n- **Relevance rating (3/5):** The summary touches on job search strategies, which are related to career and interviews, but it lacks direct references to interviews, workplace culture, or how these specific tools relate to interviewing. Including more guidance directly related to preparing for interviews would increase relevance.\n\n**Suggestions for improvement:**\n1. **Enhance Clarity:**\n   - Provide examples or a brief explanation on how to maintain a structured approach during the job search.\n   - Clarify how treating the job search like a job benefits the process.\n\n2. **Improve Coherence:**\n   - Use transitional phrases to better connect the ideas of staying structured, updating LinkedIn, and utilizing tools like ChatGPT.\n   - Present the steps in logical progression, starting from preparation to action.\n\n3. **Increase Relevance:**\n   - Incorporate specific advice on preparing for interviews, such as common questions, practicing responses, or research on prospective companies.\n   - Address how these strategies specifically aid in securing interviews and performing well in them.",
