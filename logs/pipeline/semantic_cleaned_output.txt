For those suggesting PC - I appreciate the advice, but I realize I really do prefer the simplicity of console gaming after a long day at work.

Don't let FOMO (fear of missing out) on a hypothetical console rob you of 1-2 years of great gaming.

C) Skip PlayStation entirely and build a gaming PC instead.

I own every PlayStation console ever made, and here's my advice: the mid-generation "Pro" models are never as big a leap as the full generation jumps.

That said, if you really love PlayStation exclusives and just want a simple plug-and-play experience, there's nothing wrong with the PS5.
