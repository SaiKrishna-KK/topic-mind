FEEDBACK DETAILS
------------------------------
- **Clarity rating (4/5):** The summary is mostly clear and understandable. It communicates the message that a gaming PC might be a preferable choice over a PlayStation console for certain gamers, and acknowledges the value of PlayStation exclusives. However, the phrase "Don't let FOMO on a hypothetical console" is somewhat unclear, as it's not specified whether "hypothetical" is referring to a console that doesn't exist or something else.

- **Coherence rating (3/5):** The summary presents two contrasting ideas: building a gaming PC versus choosing the PlayStation 5, but it does not strongly connect these ideas. The jump from recommending a PC to suggesting the PS5 for exclusives is a bit abrupt and lacks a smooth transition.

- **Relevance rating (3/5):** The summary touches on the PlayStation but does not cover other aspects mentioned by the keywords, like Xbox, which could be relevant for a comprehensive understanding of gaming consoles. It could more directly address consoles in a broader sense, including potential comparisons or mentions of Xbox as another major console.

**Suggestions for improvement:**
1. Clarify what is meant by "hypothetical console" to avoid ambiguity.
2. Improve coherence by providing a better transition between the suggestion to build a gaming PC and the acknowledgment of PlayStation exclusives, perhaps by explaining the benefits of each option.
3. Increase relevance by incorporating a brief mention or comparison to other consoles such as Xbox to cover a broader spectrum of gaming console options.
