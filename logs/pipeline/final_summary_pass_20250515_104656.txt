Chunk 1:
figured needed antibiotics, so made an appointment with doctor. when talking to mom, who is a nurse, on the phone she said it’s serious and if can’t see the doctor that same day then need to go to urgent care. rolled sleeve all the way up and they saw red streaks going from the infected area up towards arm pit. was very surprised what happened next.
