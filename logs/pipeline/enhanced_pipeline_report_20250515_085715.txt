FEEDBACK DETAILS
------------------------------
- **Clarity rating (4/5):** The summary is mostly clear and understandable, though a bit more context or explanation could help. It effectively communicates the idea that wedding planning can expose deeper issues within a relationship. However, the transition to reconsidering the relationship based on specific behaviors could be articulated more explicitly.

- **Coherence rating (3/5):** The summary has a logical structure, starting with a broad statement and narrowing down to specifics. However, the sentence about dismissing opinions and preferences feels slightly abrupt, lacking a smooth transition from the initial statement about wedding planning. It could better connect the two ideas.

- **Relevance rating (3/5):** The summary is partially relevant to the keywords. It addresses relationships, dating, partners, and marriage to some extent. However, the notion of a breakup is only implied, not directly discussed, and the summary is more focused on wedding planning rather than broader aspects of relationships or dating.

**Suggestions for improvement:**
- Consider adding a brief sentence or phrase to explain the connection between dismissing opinions during wedding planning and broader relational issues, which could enhance clarity and coherence.
- Expand the summary to include more direct references to all the keywords, particularly focusing on how these wedding planning issues might lead to the consideration of a breakup.
- Provide examples or anecdotes to illustrate how these dynamics surface during wedding planning and affect the overall relationship.
