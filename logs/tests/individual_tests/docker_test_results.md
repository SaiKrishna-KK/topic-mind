# Docker Cross-Platform Testing Results

## Test Environment
- **Date:** 2025-05-15
- **Host OS:** macOS 24.3.0
- **Container:** Python 3.9-slim (Linux-based)

## Service Status
- **API Server (port 5001):** ⚠️ Running but experiencing timeouts
- **Streamlit UI (port 8501):** ✅ Running

## Issues Identified
1. **OpenAI Client Initialization Error:**
   - Error: `__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'`
   - Impact: Non-critical, application continues to function with a warning
   - Solution: Modify OpenAI client initialization to remove the 'proxies' parameter

2. **Model Loading Issue:**
   - Error: `Error loading DistilBART model: trying to pop from empty mode stack`
   - Impact: Non-critical, application can still process text with alternate models
   - Solution: Handle model initialization failures gracefully

3. **API Response Timeouts:**
   - Error: `HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=5001): Read timed out. (read timeout=5)`
   - Impact: Critical, affects programmatic access to the API
   - Possible causes: Model loading delays, resource constraints, or high processing load
   - Solution: Increase response timeouts, optimize model loading, add proper health check endpoints

4. **Disk Space Error:**
   - Error: `Error loading SentenceTransformer: [Errno 28] No space left on device`
   - Impact: Critical, prevents complete model loading
   - Solution: Add disk space checks before model loading, implement cleanup of temporary files, and document disk space requirements

## Cross-Platform Compatibility Notes
- Application successfully runs in Docker container (Linux)
- Python 3.9 compatibility fixes were applied (replaced `|` union operators with `Union[type1, type2]`)
- Environment variable fallbacks are working correctly
- Model downloading is functioning properly but requires sufficient disk space

## API Testing Results
```

2025-05-15 13:04:43,373 - api_tester - ERROR - ❌ API health check failed with error: HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=5001): Read timed out. (read timeout=5)

```

## Recommendations
1. Add platform-specific error handling for model loading
2. Create a more robust Docker health check mechanism
3. Implement progressive model loading (start with lighter models, load heavier ones on-demand)
4. Document environment variable requirements more clearly in README
5. Increase default timeouts for API requests in both client and server code
6. Add ready-state indicator for when models are fully loaded and the API is ready to process requests
7. Document minimum disk space requirements (approximately 1GB free space needed)
8. Implement disk space checks before attempting to download large models
