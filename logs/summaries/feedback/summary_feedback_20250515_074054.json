    "feedback": "**Clarity: 4**  \nThe summary is generally clear and communicates a coherent message about machine learning and AI. It provides distinct points about transformation, ethics, data collection, and benefits, which are understandable. However, it could be slightly improved with more precise wording or examples.\n\n**Coherence: 4**  \nThe summary maintains a logical flow, starting from the transformation machine learning brings and then moving to ethical considerations and data practices. It concludes with the benefits of AI. It covers different aspects of AI in an organized manner, but the connections between the points could be more explicit.\n\n**Relevance to the Topic Keywords: 3**  \nThe summary addresses several of the keywords such as \"machine learning,\" \"AI,\" \"ethics,\" and implicitly \"privacy\" with the mention of \"data collection practices.\" However, it fails to directly address \"deep learning,\" which is one of the keywords. More specific references to how these concepts interconnect or examples such as deep learning applications might improve relevance.",
