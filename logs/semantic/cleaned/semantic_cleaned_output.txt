Red streaks near a wound, particularly on the limbs, can indicate a spreading infection and may be an early sign of sepsis.

I know two people who had no other symptoms besides the streaks both were admitted for sepsis and in hospital for a while.

They said I may have to stay for a couple days on IV antibiotics because I had sepsis, an infection spreading through my blood stream.

When talking to my mom, who is a nurse, on the phone she said it’s serious and if I can’t see the doctor that same day then I need to go to urgent care.

Sudden onset dementia, especially in old women and diaper wearers, might be the only symptom of a bladder infection.

I was very surprised what happened next since I imagine people in urgent care see all sorts of bad stuff.

I went to urgent care and the nurse practitioner didn’t seem too worried.

If you’ve recently taken an impact to the abdomen, pain in the left shoulder can signify a ruptured spleen (though you’ll most likely experience other symptoms).

Apparently it was so serious because once the infection passes a certain threshold, people go from feeling fine like I did to deathly ill in minutes.

They freaked out saying I needed to go to the emergency room immediately.

My sister died from a antibiotic resistant blood infection back in 2021.

Apparently a stroke is not always accompanied by the other well known symptoms.

Sepsis is no joke.

I figured it could be an infection, but there was no pain or discomfort so I figured it would heal.

[Serious] What is a “seems to be harmless” symptom that requires an immediate trip to the ER?
