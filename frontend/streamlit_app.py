How to use:
1. **Paste text** into the box (e.g., from a Reddit thread, article, or other long-form content)
2. **Configure options**:
   - Enable "Clean Reddit UI elements" if you're pasting Reddit content with upvotes/timestamps/etc.
   - Adjust the number of topics to extract based on your content length
3. **Click 'Analyze Text'** to process and view the results
