r/careerguidance - Just got laid off after 5 years at the same company. Feeling lost at 35. Where do I go from here?

I (35M) just got laid off from my job as a marketing manager at a mid-sized tech company after 5 years. Our entire department (12 people) was let go as part of a "restructuring." I knew the company wasn't doing great, but this still blindsided me.

Now I'm feeling completely lost. When I was hired, I was just 30 with some decent experience. Now I'm 35 with 5 years at a single company that's known for being somewhat old-fashioned in their marketing approach.

I'm worried my skills are outdated. Everyone's talking about AI content generation, advanced analytics, and social media algorithms that I haven't really worked with. My company was very traditional - we did trade shows, print collateral, and basic digital campaigns.

My questions:
1. Should I take any job I can get quickly, or hold out for something that's a good fit?
2. Should I invest time in learning new marketing skills before applying? If so, which ones?
3. Is 35 too old to make a bigger career change? I've always been interested in UX design.

I have about 4 months of expenses saved, plus I'll get 6 weeks of severance. Located in a major city with decent job market. No kids, but have a mortgage.

Any advice from people who've navigated a mid-career layoff would be appreciated.

I'm a career coach who works with many clients in your situation. 

First, being laid off in a restructuring is NOT a reflection of your value. Remove any shame from the equation - this happens to excellent performers all the time.

Given your runway (4 months savings + 6 weeks severance), you have time to be strategic:

1. Take 1 week to process the emotional impact. It's real and needs acknowledgment.
2. Spend 2-3 weeks updating your skills - focus on LinkedIn Learning or Coursera courses in digital marketing analytics and AI marketing tools. Just enough to speak intelligently about them.
3. Start applying while continuing to learn. Most skills are learned on the job anyway.

At 35, you're NOT too old to pivot to UX design, but it would likely require more dedicated training (3-6 months) and possibly an internship or junior role. If you're passionate about it, now is actually an ideal time.

Finally, leverage your network aggressively. Over 70% of jobs at your level come through connections, not applications.

I run a marketing department at a SaaS company, and I hire people regularly. Here's my perspective:

1. Your traditional marketing experience is still valuable. Not everything is digital. Companies still need people who understand fundamental marketing principles.

2. That said, upskilling is important. Focus on:
   - Google Analytics 4 (since it replaced Universal Analytics)
   - Basic marketing automation (HubSpot certification is easy and respected)
   - Content marketing frameworks
   - A basic understanding of how AI fits into marketing workflows

3. In your interviews, emphasize your RESULTS, not just activities. "Led trade show strategy resulting in $X in pipeline" is better than "Managed trade shows."

Don't take just any job. Bad jobs drain your energy and make it harder to find good ones. Be selective but practical.

And no, 35 is definitely not too old for UX design. Some of my best UX designers came from marketing backgrounds because they understand user psychology.

I was laid off at 39 from a job I'd had for 7 years. Truly understand the feeling of being "behind" while also feeling like my experience should count for something.

My advice:
1. Update your LinkedIn immediately and set to "open to work" - I got 3 interviews just from that
2. File for unemployment right away - it takes time to process
3. Use this as an opportunity to target companies you actually WANT to work for

For skills, look at 10-15 job descriptions that interest you. Make a list of the most common required skills. Prioritize learning those.

What helped me most was creating a simple website portfolio showcasing projects and results from my previous job. This demonstrated my capabilities better than my resume alone.

I ended up landing a better job with a 15% pay increase 2.5 months after being laid off. The key was staying structured in my approach and treating the job search like a job itself.

UX Designer here who switched from marketing at age 37!

If you're interested in UX design, now is a PERFECT time to explore it. Your marketing background is actually valuable in UX - you understand audiences, messaging, and how to influence behavior.

The route I took:
1. Google UX Design Certificate (took me 4 months part-time)
2. Built a portfolio with 3 case studies
3. Did 1 volunteer project for a non-profit to get real-world experience
4. Networked like crazy with UX professionals (coffee chats, events)

My first UX role was actually a hybrid marketing/UX position that valued both skill sets, which made the transition smoother.

Happy to chat more if you want to explore this path! It's been incredibly rewarding for me.

Recruiter here. When I see candidates with 5 years at one company, I don't think "outdated" - I think "stable and committed." That's a positive in today's job-hopping environment.

Quick tips:
1. Don't hide the layoff - it was a restructuring, not performance based
2. Reach out to recruiters in your industry - we often know about unadvertised opportunities
3. Consider contract work while you're searching - it keeps income flowing and can lead to permanent roles
4. Use AI to your advantage - use ChatGPT to help update your resume and craft compelling cover letters

Regarding age: 35 is YOUNG in the overall career span. I regularly place people in their 40s and 50s in new career paths. The key is demonstrating adaptability and enthusiasm for learning.

Job searching takes longer than it used to - national average is about 4-5 months for mid-senior roles. Plan accordingly and don't get discouraged.

I was in a similar position 2 years ago. Traditional marketing background, laid off at 38, feeling behind on trends.

What worked for me:
1. I signed up for HubSpot Academy and got certified in their marketing tools (free)
2. Took a Google Analytics course (also free)
3. Did a paid workshop on AI content tools ($200 but worth it)

Then I completely rewrote my resume to emphasize TRANSFERABLE skills rather than specific tools. Leadership, strategy, audience understanding, messaging, etc.

In interviews, I was honest about my learning journey. "I've been focusing on modernizing my skill set with X, Y, Z courses and am excited to apply these new perspectives along with my solid marketing foundation."

I actually found that companies appreciated my traditional background combined with a demonstrated willingness to learn new approaches.

Got a new role after 3 months with a small salary bump. Good luck!
