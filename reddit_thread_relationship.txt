r/relationship_advice - My (28F) boyfriend (30M) refuses to compromise on our wedding plans. Need advice.

I (28F) have been with my boyfriend (30M) for 4 years now, and we got engaged 6 months ago. We're planning our wedding for next summer, but we're running into a big issue with compromising. 

I've always imagined a beach wedding with our close friends and family (around 50 people), while he wants a large traditional church wedding with 200+ guests including distant relatives and colleagues.

When I try to discuss compromise options (like a beach ceremony with a larger reception afterward), he shuts down the conversation completely. Last night, he said "My parents are paying for most of it, so they should get final say." His parents are very traditional and are pushing for the church wedding too.

The thing is, I've compromised on several other things already - the honeymoon location, the timing of the wedding, etc. But this feels like too much to give up. This is starting to make me question if this pattern will continue throughout our marriage.

Has anyone dealt with something similar? How do you find middle ground with someone who refuses to even have the conversation?

EDIT: Thank you all for the thoughtful responses. Just to clarify - his parents offered to pay, but we haven't accepted any money yet. We're both financially stable and could pay for a modest wedding ourselves.

This isn't about the wedding - it's about his inability to compromise and putting his family's wishes above yours. It's a preview of your married life. If he won't even discuss compromises with you, that's a HUGE red flag. 

Ask yourself: Is this an isolated incident or part of a pattern? If he regularly dismisses your opinions and preferences, you might want to reconsider the whole relationship, not just the wedding plans.

Couples therapy might help before moving forward with ANY wedding plans.

My wife and I went through something similar. We wanted different types of weddings, and it almost ended our relationship. Looking back, the wedding lasted one day, but the resentment lasted years.

Don't let someone else plan YOUR wedding. Period. It's your day too. 

The bigger issue is his communication style. "Shutting down" discussions is not how adults solve problems. This will happen with kids, finances, and every major decision in your future.

Have a serious conversation about communication before you say "I do."

Therapist here. Wedding planning often reveals deeper issues in relationships because it involves money, family dynamics, personal values, and the ability to problem-solve together.

His statement about his parents paying is particularly concerning - it suggests he values their input over yours on something that should be equally about both of you.

Try using "I" statements instead of accusations: "I feel unheard when we discuss wedding plans" rather than "You never listen to me."

If he still refuses to engage, consider premarital counseling. These issues won't disappear after the wedding.

I had my dream beach wedding after almost giving in to family pressure for a church wedding. Best decision I ever made.

Your wedding day should make BOTH of you happy. It's not his parents' wedding. If they're using money to control the decisions, politely decline and plan something you can afford yourselves.

This is the hill to die on. Trust me. Ten years later, I still look at my wedding photos and smile because we did it OUR way, not his mom's way.

Wedding planner here! I've seen this exact scenario play out dozens of times, and here's what I tell couples:

1. Sit down separately and each list your top 3 non-negotiables for the wedding
2. Everything else is open for compromise
3. If parents are paying, decide upfront what control that gives them

The fact that he won't even have this conversation is troubling. Most couples disagree about wedding details, but healthy couples TALK about those disagreements.

Also - church ceremony + beach reception is absolutely a thing! Many couples do split venues like this.

This is a perfect opportunity to practice conflict resolution before marriage. If you can't navigate planning a wedding together, how will you handle tougher issues?

Try this approach: "I understand having your family there is important to you. Can we talk about ways to honor that while also including elements that are meaningful to me?"

If he still refuses, suggest a neutral third party (counselor or mediator) to help you work through this. His response to that suggestion will tell you a lot about how he views conflict resolution in your relationship.

Thank you all for your perspectives. After reading all the comments, I realize this is definitely about more than just the wedding. We're going to have a serious conversation tonight about communication and compromise in our relationship. I'll suggest counseling and see how he responds to that.

I don't want to throw away 4 years, but I also don't want to commit to a lifetime with someone who doesn't value my input on important decisions. The wedding is just the beginning of many big decisions we'll face together.
