# LLM Usage Report for TopicMind Project

## Purpose of This Document
This document outlines **how the TopicMind team used Large Language Models (LLMs)**, particularly GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to support the development of various components in the system. It also provides transparency on which parts of the output were used directly vs. edited or modified.

## Team Members Involved

- **Sai Krishna Vishnumolakala** – Core pipeline integration, summarization system, and evaluation logic  
- **Harsha Reddy Palapala** – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and subreddits analysis  
- **Gagana Vivekananda** – Initial topic modeling and embedding selection  
- **Bhavitha Kakumanu** – GPT-guided summarization dataset generation and fine-tuning setup  
- **Balakrishna Mangala** – Coherence testing, error handling, and debugging integration

## Areas Where LLMs Were Used

### 1. Topic Label Refinement
LLMs were used to convert **raw keywords from BERTopic** into **human-readable labels**.  
** Prompt:**
```
You are a labeling expert. Given the keywords: ['ai', 'ethics', 'government', 'regulation', 'openai'], suggest a concise, readable topic label in under three words.
```
> GPT-3.5 was used to generate initial suggestions.  
> We manually reviewed, edited, and curated the labels to avoid generic or misleading categories.

### 2. Code Scaffolding and Debugging
LLMs helped draft initial versions of:
- `summarizer_pipeline.py`
- `topic_refiner.py`
- `train_summarizer.py`
- `bertopic_model_simple.py`

**Prompt :**
```
Create a BERTopic-like clustering model using SentenceTransformers + KMeans + TF-IDF for keyword extraction. Must run on CPU.
```

> Code generated by "claude-3.7-sonnet" was adapted, corrected for runtime edge cases, and restructured into our backend Flask/Streamlit architecture manually.

### 3. Document and Report Writing

LLMs were also used to assist with creating and refining written documentation such as:
- Architecture breakdowns
- README files
- LLM usage declarations
- Prompt logs for internal review

Prompts used included:
```
Generate a markdown file describing how our team used LLMs to support topic clustering and summarization.
```

```
Create a section for a report that explains how we replaced OpenAI topic naming with a fine-tuned keyword classifier.
```

```
Write a README section explaining how the summarization pipeline works and what models were used.
```

We edited and refined these documents manually before submission or inclusion in our GitHub repository.

---

## What We Did Not Do
- We **did not blindly copy** LLM responses.
- We **did not use LLMs to write our final codebase** without modification.
- We **did not use GPT to summarize our final paper or architecture**.

---

## Conclusion
LLMs served as intelligent assistants — much like teammates — that we queried, reviewed, debated, and corrected. Every LLM-generated artifact in this project was **heavily edited, validated, or improved by a human** before inclusion.
