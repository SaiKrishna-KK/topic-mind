r/gaming - Should I wait for PS5 Pro or buy a regular PS5 now? Need advice.

I'm finally ready to upgrade from my trusty PS4 that I've had since 2014. It's starting to show its age with newer games, and I'm getting tired of the fan noise that sounds like a jet engine during games like God of War Ragnar√∂k.

I've been saving up for a PS5, but now I'm hearing rumors that a PS5 Pro is coming in late 2024/early 2025. I'm torn on whether I should:

A) Buy a regular PS5 now and enjoy it for the next 1-2 years
B) Wait for the PS5 Pro for potentially better performance
C) Skip PlayStation entirely and build a gaming PC instead

I play mostly single-player games (God of War, Horizon, Spider-Man, etc.) and some casual multiplayer with friends. I care about graphics but I'm not a hardcore "must have 4K/120fps" person. I just want games to look good and run smoothly.

My budget is around $500-600 for the console, but I could stretch to $800 if the Pro is worth it. If I went the PC route, I'd probably spend $1200-1500.

What would you do in my position? Is the base PS5 still a good investment in 2024?

I was in the exact same position last year. Waited for the rumored Pro, got tired of waiting, bought the regular PS5 Slim, and have ZERO regrets.

Here's why the regular PS5 is still worth it now:
1. The PS5 Pro is still just a rumor - Sony hasn't confirmed anything
2. Even if it comes out, it'll likely be $100-200 more than the regular model
3. The current PS5 already runs everything beautifully
4. By the time the Pro comes out, we'll be 2+ years closer to PS6

Most importantly: you'll get 1-2 YEARS of enjoyment that you'd miss while waiting. That's dozens of amazing games you could be playing right now instead of listening to your PS4 sound like it's about to take off.

If you're not a hardcore "must have the best graphics" person, the regular PS5 is more than enough. I was blown away coming from PS4.

Honestly, for $1200-1500 you could build a PC that would absolutely smoke both the PS5 and the theoretical Pro.

Benefits of PC:
- Backwards compatibility forever
- Free online play (no PS Plus required)
- Mod support for games
- Can use it for more than just gaming
- Better sales on games
- You can upgrade individual components over time

I switched from console to PC in 2018 and it's been amazing. Sure, the initial investment is higher, but it pays off over time.

That said, if you really love PlayStation exclusives and just want a simple plug-and-play experience, there's nothing wrong with the PS5. Just know that for your budget, PC offers more raw performance.

I own every PlayStation console ever made, and here's my advice: the mid-generation "Pro" models are never as big a leap as the full generation jumps.

The PS4 Pro was nice but not revolutionary compared to base PS4. It mostly helped games hit higher resolutions, but many still had frame rate issues.

The current PS5 is already so capable that I'm not sure what a Pro model would significantly improve. Maybe slightly better ray tracing? A few more frames per second? It won't be a night and day difference.

If you've waited this long on your PS4, the jump to a regular PS5 will feel MASSIVE. The SSD alone changes the experience completely - no more long loading screens!

My vote: Get the PS5 now and enjoy the huge improvement.

Let's break this down logically:

1. Current PS5 ($500) - Available now, proven performance, large game library
2. PS5 Pro ($600-700 estimated) - Available maybe late 2024, somewhat better performance
3. PC ($1200-1500) - Available now, best performance, most versatile

If the PS5 Pro follows the pattern of PS4 Pro, expect:
- 20-30% better GPU performance
- Same CPU with maybe slightly higher clock
- Same SSD speed
- Maybe 2TB storage vs 1TB

Is that worth waiting a year+ for? Probably not if you're eager to upgrade now.

The base PS5 already targets 4K/60 for most games, with some supporting 120fps modes at lower resolutions. If that meets your needs, why wait?

Regarding PC - it's obviously more powerful but requires more technical knowledge and lacks some PlayStation exclusives (though Sony is bringing more to PC lately).

My recommendation: PS5 now, enjoy it, then maybe consider PC for your next upgrade in 3-4 years when PS6 is on the horizon.

I've had a PS5 since launch day, and here's my perspective:

The biggest upgrades from PS4 to PS5 are:
1. Lightning-fast load times (literally 2-3 seconds for most games)
2. Significantly better graphics and frame rates
3. The DualSense controller's haptic feedback (seriously underrated feature)
4. Much quieter operation (your jet engine concerns will be gone)

I play all the same games you mentioned (God of War, Horizon, Spider-Man) and they are STUNNING on the base PS5. Spider-Man with ray-traced reflections is mind-blowing.

To directly answer your question: if you can get a PS5 for $499 now, do it. You'll get amazing experiences for the next 2 years, and even if a Pro comes out, your regular PS5 will still run every game in the PS5 ecosystem.

Don't let FOMO (fear of missing out) on a hypothetical console rob you of 1-2 years of great gaming.

One thing nobody else has mentioned: the potential price difference.

Base PS5 now: $499
PS5 Pro (rumored): $599-699

So you're looking at a $100-200 premium. For that same $200, you could buy:
- 3-4 full-price games
- 2 years of PS Plus
- An extra controller + charging dock

My approach to console cycles: buy the base model, enjoy it for 5-6 years, then jump to the next generation. The mid-cycle refreshes have never been worth the wait/price for me personally.

If you really want to maximize value, the PS5 Slim with disc drive is the sweet spot right now. You can still buy/sell/trade physical games which saves a ton of money long-term.

OP [Comment reply]
Thanks everyone for the incredibly detailed responses! I think I've made my decision - I'm going to grab a PS5 Slim this weekend. The points about actually enjoying games now vs waiting for a hypothetical upgrade really resonated with me.

For those suggesting PC - I appreciate the advice, but I realize I really do prefer the simplicity of console gaming after a long day at work. Maybe next generation I'll consider the switch.

I'll report back after I've had some time with the PS5 to share my thoughts on the upgrade experience from PS4!
